# Discord guild copy

## Information
Did you ever want to create a copy of a guild? Now you can! There is no need to manually create roles, channels and permissions, which can take very long depending on the original guilds size. The script does everything for you. It backs up a guild into a single file and lets you create a new guild from it. You can share your file with others, too.

### What will be copied
- Categories
- Text & Voice channels
- Roles (also managed ones)
- Role permissions for categories and text/voice channels (no user specific ones)
- Emojis (see [Disclaimer](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy#disclaimer))
- Bans

### What will not be copied
- Chat history
- Invites
- Webhooks
- Audit Logs
- Third party integrations (Twitch/Youtube)

## What do I need
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) any version >= 8.0.0 should work
- [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) The latest version **_not the stable release._** ([Explanation](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy#why-using-120-dev-and-not-the-stable-release))
  - This will automatically be downloaded. See Installation for more information.
- A Discord account with a bot user
  - Discord Developer page [link](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) to create a bot
- A preferably empty guild which can be overwritten

## Disclaimer
**_Use this script at your own risk!_**

According to the recent [statement](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots000000) of the discord team, any kind of user accounts including so called SelfBots are forbidden. The script must be run with a bot user token.

## Installation & Usage
1. Download the repository from github
2. Unzip it
3. Navigate into the extracted folder
4. Edit the `settings.json` and fill in all necessary data (see [Settings](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy#settings) for more information)
5. Open the console and run `npm install` (on windows you can shift + right click inside the project folder folder and select 'open command prompt here')
6. Run `node copy.js` in the console to print usage

## Settings
To get the id of a guild open your client settings -> Appearance and then enable developer mode. If you now right click on a guild you can select 'Copy ID'.

| Variable | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| originalGuildId | The id of the guild you want to clone. Can be left blank if a guildData.json already exists. |
| newGuildId | The id of the new guild you want to clone to. |
| newGuildAdminRoleId | The id of a role with administrator permissions. The bot needs to have this role on the new guild! You can manually create a new role called 'guildcopy' and the script will automatically use it. If you do so, just leave this field empty. |
| copyEmojis | default: false - set to true to copy emojis (see also [Common Behaviour](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy#common-behaviour)) |
| copyBans | default: false - set to true to copy banned users The bot needs to have the BAN_MEMBERS permission on the original guild if you enable this! |
| debug | default: false - set to true for a more detailed general and error output e.g. when creating an issue |
| token | Your account token. The bot does not need any permissions on the original guild (only exception: copyBans=true). |

## Common Behaviour
- New guild cleanup
  - Emoji Creation/Deletion: This will take time, especially if there are lot of them. Expect a few rateLimits when 'debug' is on. If 'copyEmojis' is disabled, emojis on the new server won't be deleted or new ones added.
  - Bans Creation/Deletion: see 'Emoji Creation/Deletion' above
  - Channel Deletion: The client might still show deleted channels despite them already being deleted. To fix this, just restart your discord client. You can do this while the script is running.
- Region
  - Some guilds have VIP regions which cannot be used by normal guilds. Therefore if you copy such a guild the region will be set to us-central.

## Why using v12.0-dev and not the stable release
This was developed when 11.2.1 was the latest version which wasn't able to provide all needed features (e.g. categories, permsissions) to clone a whole guild. A port/rewrite to 11.3.X (or any version <12.0) and then to 12.0 again would just be unnecessary busywork.
I will probably switch to the stable release as soon as 12.0 is stable.

I try to check new commits for changes which might break something but if I miss one, feel free to remind me ;D

## Issues
Most of the common issues are displayed in the console while running the script. If you encounter crashes or any other weird behaviour not listed [here](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy#common-behaviour) feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy/issues/new). The script creates logs in the 'logs' folder. Feel free to upload those to something like [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and add them to the created issue to help me find the problem.

### Can I suggest new features (or complain about ugly code)
Of course, just create an [issue](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy/issues/new) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Jisagi/Discord-guild-copy/compare).
